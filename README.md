# Healthcare ETL Pipeline & Analytics Platform

## 🏥 Business Problem
Hospitals and healthcare systems need to reduce readmissions, optimize treatment costs, and improve patient outcomes. This project demonstrates how to build a comprehensive ETL pipeline that processes healthcare claims and EHR data to provide actionable insights for healthcare decision-makers.

## 🎯 Solution Overview
A modern data engineering pipeline that:
- **Extracts** raw healthcare data from multiple sources
- **Transforms** and cleans data using industry-standard practices
- **Loads** structured data into a PostgreSQL data warehouse
- **Analyzes** patterns in readmissions, costs, and patient journeys
- **Visualizes** insights through interactive dashboards
- **Enables** natural language queries through AI-powered chatbot

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Data Processing**: Python (pandas, PySpark)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow
- **Visualization**: Streamlit, Power BI
- **AI/ML**: LangChain, OpenAI
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Cloud**: Docker, AWS (optional)

## 📋 Sample Queries

### Top Cost Drivers
```sql
SELECT diagnosis_code, SUM(cost) as total_cost
FROM Claims
GROUP BY diagnosis_code
ORDER BY total_cost DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Readmission Rates by Hospital
```sql
SELECT hospital_name, 
       AVG(readmission_flag)::numeric(10,2) as readmission_rate
FROM Claims c
JOIN Providers p ON c.provider_id = p.provider_id
GROUP BY hospital_name
ORDER BY readmission_rate DESC;
```

## 🤖 AI Chatbot
Ask natural language questions like:
- "Which diagnosis groups drive 80% of costs?"
- "Show me readmission rates by region"
- "What's the average cost per patient for diabetes?"

## 📊 Dashboard Features
- **KPI Cards**: Key metrics at a glance
- **Cost Analysis**: Breakdown by diagnosis and provider
